Georges' arm

Georges' arm is an application coupled with embedded system that allow to control a robot arm with your android smartphone.
This arm is handmade and is controled by an PIC system generating PWM for the servos.
The application count three tabs : 
x Bluetooth 
The communication between the smartphone and the arm use bluetooth.
In this tab we can couple/connect/configure/disconnect the Bluetooth connections between the two systems. 
x Calibration
The arm can be guided by a couple of the embedded Smartphone's sensors, therefore it must be calibrated before use.
In this tab we can calibrate the 3 axis accelerometer and the compass for a better user experience.
x Control
The arm can be guided in two differents ways, by cursors display of the screen of the smartphone or using the embedded smartphone's sensors. 
In this tab the arm will reproduce all the movements of the smartphone and apply all the values of differents cursors.

And all of that in a fancy design !


Missiles snapshots

This embedded system allow to take an high amount of pictures of a missile ignition.

The goal of the system is to detect the exact moment of a missile ignition and then command up to two cameras to take pictures of this launch.

The missile can be from different types:
Anti-tank missile (or any missile fire from a earthbound tripod)
Sea-Sea/Ground/Air missile (fire from a aircraft carrier)

The detection of the missile's ignition can be made by :
Detection of flames
Detection of sound (detonation of the ignition)
Detection of the openning from the gas extraction trap by differents sort of sensors.

Inside the box we can configure a delay before snapshots will be taken, the duration of the snapshots and an alarm to keep awake the cameras.
And then high-power LEDs display the different states of the system (ignition detection, battery level, camera 1/2 state).

In addition the whole system is waterproof (can stay in the water at 60 meters depth for 2 weeks) and can run up to 72 hours nonstop.

During testing process both cameras have taken snapshots at a speed of 60 frame/second, but the management system has no limitated speed.


Freescale Cup

The Freescale Cup is a global competition where student teams build, program, and race a model car around a track for speed. 
The fastest car to complete the track without derailing, wins.

I take part of this race with another teammate in the Haute Ecole ARC race team in 2015, we finished second of the France-Switzerland final and 8<sup>th</sup> of the EMEA final.
We are also ranked 64<sup>th</sup> worldwide (out of a total of 35.000 students parcipating).

The track is composed of different known circuit parts. Each part have different forms but all have a white background and one black line of both borders.
With this two black lines and the embedded car's camera we can determine through digital processing the location of the lines. 
Then we can ajust the comportment of the car, regulate the direction of the car and the speed of each rear wheels.

The biggest challenge is to adopt the more aggressive drive comportment dealing with the physical constraint of the little weight of the car.
